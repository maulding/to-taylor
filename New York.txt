To whom it may concern,

My name is Ryan, but some people; jokingly, have been calling me Яу, and many more call me Ry. My grandmother (God rest her soul) called me Joey.

I’ve had my life stolen by Miss Taylor Swift. I’m a large part of the creative source behind the Reputation album; with the shining star being Look What You Made Me Do which is a narrative about me coming to terms with and accepting my own fate on this planet as I went through drug treatment in Skagit County, Washington from 2011 until 2014.

While I was undergoing treatment I felt like the black dog, like the prize of the great hunt. I was also feeling like Santa Clause and the Pied Piper, and I did on several occasions find myself rhyming for at least 24 hours in my apartment by myself to try and win Pan’s challenge.

The old Ryan is dead, but he came back stronger, he came back faster, he came back harder, be came back more prepared to face the challenges set before him by God.

I’ve spent the last ten years of my life being tortured, poisoned and raped by the people of Washington state, and I believe Miss Swift has some part to play in that.

My next step is to leave the lower 48 and start working on a manuscript that talks in detail about my perception of what happened to me after coming into contact with Miss Swift and her associates. It is a very thought compelling and heartbreaking story and will make for an excellent read.

Thanks,

P.S. It was Pixie, not Pussy… Yulia sells pussy, and I programmed computers; until you happened.
